          <p>While writing your goals for 2021, you may be thinking that it’s time for a job or career change. Here are some tips for determining whether it’s the right time for you to make the switch and how you can approach the switch.</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Are you finding that your job is unmotivating?<ul>
          <li>If you’ve been at your job for a significant time—more than five years—then you may be feeling like your work is becoming uninteresting. In turn, you’re less likely to be motivated to do the work. </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Do you feel like you’re not making a difference?<ul>
          <li>If you find yourself doing menial tasks or tasks that are below your capabilities, then you may want to consider doing something more worthwhile. If your strengths are not being put to good use by doing projects that allow you to show your best abilities, then maybe it’s time to move on.   </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Does your job teach you new things and cultivate your skills?    <ul>
          <li>If you’re not learning new things, then it may be time to consider moving on to a new job that will provide projects to stimulate and challenge you.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Do you feel like there’s no room for advancement?<ul>
          <li>If you have an awful boss who puts you down, then you may feel stuck in your job with no room to move up the ladder. And if you’re not moving up the ladder, your salary is likely stagnant too. The only way to get more compensation and more upward mobility is, sadly, to leave your job for another one. </li>
          <li>If you’re experiencing any of the things I’ve just discussed, then consider changing jobs. Ideally, you want to have a job lined up before you jump ship, but it’s not the end of the world if you don’t. I have at least two very successful friends (both white collar professionals in the management levels) who once quit their unfulfilling jobs—without another one lined up. Both are doing well in new, better jobs.  </li>
          <li>Don’t be afraid of what’s next. If you plan carefully and know what it is you want to do next and really hustle to achieve that next thing, things will work out. Never let fear be a motivator for your actions. </li>
          <li>I’m a big fan of Oprah, and one thing that she has said that’s really stuck with me is that if you’re  doing what you love, the money will follow. I do caution though that it takes hard work! Don’t think things will miraculously work themselves out. You need to work really hard for it. But don’t stay at your current job out of fear that you won’t find better positions. Again, don’t let fear be your motivator in life. </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ol>
