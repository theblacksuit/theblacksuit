          <p>The holidays are a great time to keep in touch with folks and nurture social relationships.  As I’ve mentioned in my prior videos, marketing and networking is very important in any business, particularly service-based businesses like law.  If you know how to network and market yourself, you can find amazing job leads that aren’t available to the public; not to mention, good networking skills will help you land clients, which in turn increase your position and status within your firm. 
          Practicing and honing my networking skills allowed me to land my first BigLaw job after law school. I saw a job lead that I was interested in, and someone in my network knew the person in charge of hiring for the position and helped me get an interview.  </p>
          <p>Here are some tips to help you network during the holidays, and they don’t require you to break any social distancing requirements.</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Send holiday cards or gifts<ul>
          <li>Don’t underestimate the power of holiday cards or simple gifts. Recipients will be happy to see that you care enough to send some warm holiday greetings, particularly in the current pandemic when everyone is experiencing prolonged isolation. </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If you want to make even more of an impression on your connections, then send a small gift with your holiday card.</li>
          <li>Virtual holiday parties<ul>
          <li>We can’t have in-person holiday parties this year, but virtual parties are a great replacement.  Friends have invited me to their virtual holiday parties, and these parties are perfect for catching up with others.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Update social media<ul>
          <li>If you don’t have time to send holiday cards or host virtual parties, then I encourage you to up your social media game at the very least. Connect with your friends and acquaintances by sending a quick hello and ask how they’re doing.  Social media can be impersonal, so your messages may be ignored or overlooked, but don’t let this deter you. Even if only one out of every ten people you contact looks at your message, it’s one more connection that you’ll have strengthened and nurtured for the future.  </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Be thoughtful in your holiday cards and messages to your network<ul>
          <li>Try your best to personalize your holiday cards that are sent to people in your network. Generic messages or greetings don’t have as much impact as ones with more personal touches. To the extent you can, find out if your contact has achieved any milestones this year or other highlights that are worth a mention in your message. </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ol>
