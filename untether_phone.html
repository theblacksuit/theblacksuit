          <h1 id="the-black-suit-3-untethering">WORK LIFE BALANCE. Untether from work calls, emails. Practicing self care. Stop phone addiction.</h1>
          <p align="center"><iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ti8hvUQFIyE"></iframe></p>
          <p>In the previous video, I received requests to discuss how to balance life and work. </p>
          <p>With the holiday season coming up, it&#39;s especially important to manage your work life to that you can still enjoy the holidays. </p>
          <p>Some folks have asked that I share my personal experience with work/life balance. </p>
          <ul>
          <li>My first year, I was not very good. I worked almost all day on Thanksgiving.</li>
          <li>The next few years were also not great, I worked a lot.</li>
          <li>This year, I&#39;ve taken more personal time, as it has been a difficult year with the pandemic.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Also, it&#39;s important to give youself time to enjoy the holidays and not feel tethered to work. </p>
          <p>Research has shown that the more we feel tethered to out phone and/or work while at home, the more likely we are to feel tense and unhappy (<a href="https://www.academia.edu/42914049/Not_at_the_Table_A_Diary_Study_Analyzing_the_Effects_of_Constant_Connectivity_on_Work_Family_Conflict">source</a>).</p>
          <p>Other side effects of poor work life balance include:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Psychological distress </li>
          <li>Family feeling like you&#39;re not present </li>
          <li>Feeling stressed and upset. One Thanksgiving I was so preoccupied with work that I felt too busy to preheat the oven to cook the turkey!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here are some tips that can help!</p>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Tell yourself that you will not check your phone</strong><ol>
          <li>If this isn&#39;t possible, check your phone only twice per day.</li>
          <li>Say it out loud to yourself. Get a mirror!</li>
          <li>Or - write your commitment down on a piece of paper!</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Put your phone in a different room or hide it so that you don&#39;t impulsively check it</strong><ol>
          <li>Have a family member hide it for you (you won&#39;t know where it is)!</li>
          <li>Make a bet with someone that you won&#39;t use your phone.</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>If you want to start with baby steps first, TURN OFF NOTIFICATIONS</strong><ol>
          <li>Airplane mode</li>
          <li>Do not disturb mode</li>
          <li>Deactive alerts for specific apps</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Do some other activities to distract yourself from the urge to check your phone</strong><ol>
          <li>Cook turkey. Try a new mashed potatoe recipe. </li>
          <li>Host video chats or conferences with your friends and family. </li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Remember that rarely will an issue or task be so urgent that you have to respond immediately</strong><ol>
          <li>Courts are closed on holidays. Clients are not always working.</li>
          <li>You can respond on Black Friday or on Saturday or Sunday. </li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you try these tips, you&#39;ll feel more relaxed and able to enjoy the holiday</p>
          <p>If someone were to ask me today if I regret working on holidays, I would say that I don&#39;t, but I&#39;m not sure it made much of a difference in the long run. </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Would have been fine whether I had completed a project on Thanksgiving, or a bit later.</li>
          <li>If you don&#39;t untether, you&#39;re more likely to burn out and make bad decisions.</li>
          <li>Some firms have recognized this and have policies in place to prevent employees from checking emails or logging in to work systems after hours. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>So remember, untether from your phone and work! It is healthy and will make you more productive in the long run. </p>
